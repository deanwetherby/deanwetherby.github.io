While executing the technical vision for some of our company's software projects, I oftentimes need to challenge my team's assumptions as well as my own. Are we still building the right thing? Can our current approach be improved in any way? What problems can we envision having in the future and how can we address these now? I like to ask these questions during our sprint retrospectives which occasionally lead to a follow-on brainstorming session.

The point of brainstorming is to look beyond the obvious solutions. The quantity of ideas is more important than quality at this stage. One idea may spur additional thoughts that vary slightly. Some may not have merit while others are worth pursuing but all thoughts are viable and welcome. Often, a few ideas have enough merit to be worthy of an initial software prototype. To me, the word 'divergent' implies out-of-the-box thinking or, for that matter, constructing an entirely new box. In this way, I encourage my team members to be divergent-thinking developers.

The blog is called "The Divergent Developer" for these reasons. One could make the case for the slightly less catchy "The Divergent-thinking Developer" since I am in no way implying that the developer should diverge or deviate from their team.

In future posts, expect both traditional and untraditional topics. I am as likely to provide technical tutorials on AWS, AI, and Python that fit nicely within the normalcy box as well as some untraditional out-of-the-box ideas rattling around in my head. I hope the reader will consider both for their own software practice.
